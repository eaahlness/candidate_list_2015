# candidate_list_2015
Norwegian Party List Candidates from 5% most and least diverse Municipalities, 2015

My unique identifier is the name of each candidate. I have ensured there are no repeats of any unique identifiers. The variables in my analysis are:

Party: What political party the individual belongs to. Most regressions are conducted on the nine largest political parties. All graphs are scaled right-to-left according to the leanings of the parties, from conservative to liberal. 

Rank: Where each individual falls in order of possible candidacy for their party. Parties in the same municipality may have different list lengths; similarly, a party may vary immensely in list length depending on the size of the municipality. 

rank_perc: This variable turns the ranking of each individual in a percentile. 

Gender: Candidates are ranked ‘Male’ or ‘Female.’ There is no account for non-gender conforming individuals. 

Male: A dummy variable for Gender, Male = 1. 

Norwegian: Determines whether a candidate is Norwegian or ‘Non’ (an immigrant or child of two immigrants). 

Ethnicity: This variable applies to ‘Non’ candidates only, providing state of origin. 

Region: Details the wider region (as compared to specific state) a candidate is from. 

Birth.Year: Provides birth year of candidate. Priority: Details whether an individual falls within the first or second ranks for a party within a municipality with YES or NO. 

County: Provides the county the municipality is a part of. 

Municipality: The municipality an individual runs as a candidate in. Code: A 4-digit numerical code for the Municipality of a candidate.
